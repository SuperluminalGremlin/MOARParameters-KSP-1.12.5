Introducing MOARParameters, a mod for introducing cool parameters to Contract Configurator. 

So far, I have written 1 new Parameter. The glorious DownrangeDistance. Yes, you heard that right

THE FABELED DOWNRANGE CONTRACTS FROM RP-1 WILL BE ABLE TO BE WRITTEN INTO STOCK

I shall be working on Contracts that make full usage of these new capabilities.


FORMAT

		PARAMETER

		{

			name = ReachDistance

			type = DownrangeDistance

			distance = [INSERT AMOUNT IN METERS]

			title = self-explanatory, really

		}
